# Izhikevich Neuron Model Simulator
---
Python toolkit for simulating and analyzing the Izhikevich neuron model, a computationally efficient spiking neuron model described in *Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience* by Eugene Izhikevich. This repository provides tools for current injections, forward integration of the neuron model, and visualization (voltage traces, recovery dynamics, F-I curves, and phase diagrams). 

Work in progress...
