# Izhikevich Neuron Model Simulator
---
Python toolkit for simulating and analyzing the Izhikevich neuron model, a computationally efficient spiking neuron model described in *Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience* by Eugene Izhikevich. This repository provides tools for:
- Developing current injection protocols with arbitrary complexity
- Forward integration of the Izhikevich model
- Frequency-current curves for determining the neuron's excitability class
- Visualization of voltage traces, recovery dinamics, and phase diagrams
  
Work in progress...
