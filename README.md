# Izhikevich Neuron Model Simulator
---
Python toolkit for simulating and analyzing the Izhikevich neuron model, a computationally efficient spiking neuron model described in *Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience* by Eugene Izhikevich. Features include:
- Current injection protocols of arbitrary complexity (ramps, pulses, zaps, noise)
- Forward integration of the Izhikevich model equations with Euler method
- Frequency-current curves to classify neuronal excitability
- Visualization tools for voltage traces, recovery dynamics, and phase-space analysis
